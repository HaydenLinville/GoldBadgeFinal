# Gold Badge Final

Gold Badge Final contains three projects: **Cafe**, **Company Outings**, and **Green Plan**

**Cafe** - Console app that creates, reads, and deletes items from a menu. The items contain a meal number, meal name, a description of the meal, a list of ingredients and the price.   


**Company Outings** - Console app that creates, reads, and updates outings on a list. Each outing contains the type of event, number of people that attended, when the event took place, how much it cost per person, and how much the total cost of the event. The console app also calculates the total spent on all events. 


**Green Plan** - Console app that creates, reads, updates, and deletes three different lists of cars (*Electric*, *Gas*, and *Hybrid*). Each car contains a Make, Model, Cost, and each review if the car is fast (all *Gas* cars are fast, all *Electric* cars are slow, and *Hybrid* cars could be either).
